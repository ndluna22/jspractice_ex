// Write a function called guessingGame which returns a function that allows you to guess a random whole number between 0 and 99. Every time you create a new game, it should select a new random number, and keep it secret from the player.

// Once the game has started, you can guess the number. The game should tell you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

// After a correct guess, the game ends.

function guessingGame() {
  const ANSWER = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
  let isOver = false;
  let numGuesses = 0;

    if (isOver) return "The game is over, you already won!";
    numGuesses++;
    if (num === ANSWER) {
      isOver = true;
      const guess = numGuesses === 1 ? "guess" : "guesses";
      return `You win! You found ${num} in ${numGuesses} ${guess}.`;
    }
    if (num < ANSWER) return `${num} is too low!`;
    if (num > ANSWER) return `${num} is too high!`;
